    "content": "As opposed to a [down universe](philosophy/down_universe). In this framework, one assumes there is an infinitely large, singular reality that is in and of itself, the inherent reality of the universe. Every phenomenon is simply a subset of this overarching reality.\n\nThe most common up universe framework is that of Abrahamic religions - there is a singular God who has determined all of reality, and everything that happens is simply a result of his arbitrary and unknowable will. In this universe no progress can be made in understanding the universe - one must submit to the fact that without knowing everything, one knows absolutely nothing."
