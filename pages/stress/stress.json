    "title": "Stress",
    "content": "Stress, in its simplest sense, is the inability of something to meet the demands placed upon it. The stress we undergo as humans is exactly the same.\n\nTo understand this better, one must first accept that [we are not alive](philosophy/down_universe). The cells, the true life forms that work together in the society of organisms that is the human body, are the individual living beings that undergo stress. What we [experience](philosophy/consciousness) is 'meta-stress', or the cumulative effects of the cells that make up our bodies undergoing collective stress.\n\nIt follows that we experience stress when our cells undergo stress. Our cells undergo stress when more is demanded of them than they can keep up with - this can be due to [damage to their structures](stress/environmental_stressors), [lack of nutrients](nutrition/sugar), or excessive demands from the body, whether they be [physical](stress/physical_stress) or [mental](stress/mental_stress)."
